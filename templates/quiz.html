            <p class="mb-3">Looking for movie recommendations? ðŸŽ¬ You've come to the right place! At the end of The Quizâ„¢, you
                will recieve four movie recommendations generated by our super secret ðŸ¤« algorithm. You can then add these to
                your watchlist. Get started by clicking the Start Quiz! button below.

            <h5 class="mb-3">How it works:</h5>
            <p>The Quizâ„¢ will have four questions. The first two ask the user to select a movie, the third question will 
                ask the user to select a year, and the last question asks the user to select a word (which is selected 
                randomly from the movie titles). Then, the user will recieve movie recommendations based on their 
                selections. We have filtered the movie options that The Quizâ„¢ will recommend to the user movies that were 
                released after 2010, have over 1000 ratings, and have over 7 stars in the rating. These filters were 
                implemented with the purpose of quality control in the movie recommendations.</p>
